# ProTag
A react based mockup of the modern e-commerce websites that use way too many animations.

## Tools Used
* Frontend:
  * TypeScript React
  * React router for navigation
  * Sass
  * GreenSock AP for animations
* Backend:
  * NodeJS server
  * ExpressJS
  * MySQL database
 
 ## Preview
 Preview is available [here on netlify.](https://screactecom.netlify.app/). This website is preview of just the frontend and is not connected to the backend.
 
 A [separate repository](https://github.com/soft-coded/react-ecom-website-frontend) handles this preview, which is identical to the "frontend" folder here, minus the fetch requests.
